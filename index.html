            Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human
            intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans
            and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine
            that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning
            and problem-solving.

            <p>
              Machine Learning is more than just a buzzword these days. It is a
              leap forward in technology, demonstrating how computers can learn
              from data. Machine Learning can solve a plethora of problems, and
              it is all based on data and the use of algorithms. This pathway
              introduces fundamental cloud computing and basic Machine Learning
              concepts. You will examine the basic Machine Learning ecosystem,
              and explore the learning process. Additionally, you will review
              the required competencies needed in the field of Machine Learning.

            <p>
              Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning) is part of
              a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial
              neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be
              supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.Deep learning
              architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks,
              recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks have
              been applied to fields including computer vision, speech
              recognition, natural language processing etc.

              Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning
              concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an
              environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward.
              Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning
              paradigms.Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning
              in not needing labelled input/output pairs be presented, and in
              not needing sub-optimal actions to be explicitly corrected..

              <h1>Recurrent Neural Network</h1>
              <h2>RNN</h2>
              <p>
                Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a variation to feed-forward
                (FF) networks. In this type, each of the neurons in hidden
                layers receives an input with a specific delay in time. We use
                this type of neural network where we need to access previous
                information in current iterations. For example, when we are
                trying to predict the next word in a sentence, we need to know
                the previously used words first. RNNs can process inputs and
                share any lengths and weights across time. The model size does
                not increase with the size of the input, and the computations in
                this model take into account the historical information.
                However, the problem with this neural network is the slow
                computational speed. Moreover, it cannot consider any future
                input for the current state. It cannot remember info from a long
                time ago.

                Convolutional Neural Networks are neural networks used primarily
                for classification of images, clustering of images and object
                recognition. DNNs enable unsupervised construction of
                hierarchical image representations. DNNs are used to add much
                more complex features to it so that it can perform the task with
                better accuracy.

              <p>
                LSTM networks introduce a memory cell. They can process data
                with memory gaps. Above, we can notice that we can consider time
                delay in RNNs, but if our RNN fails when we have a large number
                of relevant data, and we want to find out relevant data from it,
                then LSTMs is the way to go. Also, RNNs cannot remember data
                from a long time ago, in contrast to LSTMs.

              <p>
                A Boltzmann machine network involves learning a probability
                distribution from an original dataset and using it to make
                inference about unseen data. In BMs, there are input nodes and
                hidden nodes, as soon as all our hidden nodes change its state,
                our input nodes transform into output nodes. For instance:
                Suppose we work in a nuclear power plant, where safety must be
                the number one priority. Our job is to ensure that all the
                components in the powerplant are safe to use, there will be
                states associated with each component, using booleans for
                simplicity 1 for usable and 0 for unusable. However, there will
                also be some components for which it will be impossible for us
                to measure the states regularly.

              <p>
                Given training data, GANs learn to generate new data with the
                same statistics as the training data. For example, if we train
                our GAN model on photographs, then a trained model will be able
                to generate new photographs that look authentic to the human
                eye. The objective of GANs is to distinguish between real and
                synthetic results so that it can generate more authentic
                results.
